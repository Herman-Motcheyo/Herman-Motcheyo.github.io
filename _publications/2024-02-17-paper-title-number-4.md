This work combines machine learning with materials science to optimize sustainable building materials. We develop a hybrid feature selection methodology to identify key porosity-hygroscopy correlations in geopolymer matrices, contributing to energy-efficient indoor thermal comfort solutions through AI-driven material optimization.
