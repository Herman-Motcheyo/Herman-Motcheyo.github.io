<h2>CRI'2025 - The 7th edition of Conference on Research in Computer Science CRI’2025</h2>

<p><strong>Location:</strong> Yaoundé, Cameroon<br/>
<strong>Date:</strong> 16 Decembre 2025<br/>
<strong>Event:</strong> The seventh edition of Conference on Research in Computer Science –Conférence de Recherche en Informatique– CRI’2025 (CRI'2025)</p>

<h3>Presentation Details</h3>

<p>At CRI'2025, I presented my research on <strong>"Still Malignant if You Were a Woman? Auditing Group and Counterfactual Fairness in Dermatological AI."</strong> This work addresses critical fairness concerns in AI-powered dermatological diagnosis systems, examining how these models may exhibit biases across different demographic groups.</p>

<p>The presentation showcased a comprehensive fairness auditing framework that combines group fairness metrics to assess disparate performance across demographic groups, counterfactual fairness analysis to evaluate whether predictions would change if sensitive attributes were different, and clinical validation using dermatological datasets to identify potential biases in skin lesion classification. This research highlights the urgent need for fairness-aware AI in healthcare applications, particularly in dermatology where existing datasets and models may underrepresent certain skin tones and demographic groups.</p>

<h3>Abstract & Publication</h3>

<p><strong>Status:</strong> Accepted at CRI'2025<br/>
<strong>Type:</strong> Full paper presentation</p>

<p>The paper proposed multimodal CNN and provided an audit of fairness disparities in  dermatological AI(skin lesion) systems and proposes methodologies for auditing to ensure equitable healthcare delivery.</p>

<h3>Conference Impact</h3>
