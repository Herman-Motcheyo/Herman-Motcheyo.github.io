Presented our research on auditing fairness in dermatological AI systems, focusing on the intersection of group fairness and counterfactual fairness in clinical decision support. This work, co-authored with Lauraine Tiogning-Djiogue, examined how AI diagnostic systems may produce disparate outcomes across demographic groups, particularly regarding skin cancer detection across gender and skin tone.

Key contributions discussed:
- Novel framework for auditing both group-level and counterfactual fairness in medical AI
- Analysis of bias in dermatological image classification systems
- Generation of biologically plausible counterfactual examples for fairness evaluation
- Empirical evaluation on dermatology datasets with intersectional demographic attributes
- Practical implications for clinical deployment of AI diagnostic tools

The presentation highlighted critical disparities in model performance across protected attributes and proposed methodological approaches using optimal transport and causal inference to generate counterfactuals that respect biological constraints while enabling rigorous fairness auditing.
